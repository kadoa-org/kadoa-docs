With our Websocket API, you can listen to real-time changes for your workflows.

## Introduction

We recommend using our SDKs to listen to real-time changes. It implements all the necessary logic to handle the connection, authentication, message acknowledgement, redevlivery and reconnection logic.

If you still want to integrate by yourself reach out to us and we can help you set it up.

## Features

- Real-time change delivery
- Message acknowledgement and redelivery
- Heartbeat and reconnection logic

## Message format

All messages are JSON objects with the following fields:

Always present:

- `type`: The type of the message.
- `timestamp`: The timestamp of the message.

Optional depending on the type:

- `data`: The data of the message.
- `id`: The ID of the message used for acknowledgement.

## Types

### `workflow_data_change`

This message is sent when a workflow data changes.

### `workflow_state_change`

### `heartbeat`

<Note>
  SDKs will handle the heartbeat logic for you. You don't need to implement it.
</Note>

This message is sent every 15 seconds. It's used to keep the connection alive. If you don't receive a heartbeat after 30 seconds, the connection is considered dead you should reconnect.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "heartbeat",
  "timestamp": 1736367604663
}
```
