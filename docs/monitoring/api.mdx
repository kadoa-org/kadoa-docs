  This guide focusses on real-time monitoring which is currently only available for
  Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).
</Note>

The Kadoa API offers multiple endpoints to manage your real-time monitoring workflows and changes.

- Fetch all active real-time monitoring workflows
- Fetch all changes for a specific workflow / workflows

## Fetch all active real-time monitoring workflows

Use the following endpoint to retrieve your workflows:

**GET** `/v4/workflows`

[See API Reference](/api-reference/workflows/get-all-workflows)

The response will include all workflows that are in your scope (user, team, organization).

To get all workflows that are active and have real-time monitoring enabled, you can use the following query parameter:

```
?state=ACTIVE&monitoring=true&updateInterval=REAL_TIME
```

<Note>
  Be careful - this API is paginated and you will per default only fetch 25
  workflows at a time. You can also adjust the `limit` query parameter to fetch
  more workflows with one request.
</Note>

### Example Request

Fetch all workflows that are active and have real-time monitoring enabled with a limit of 100:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/workflows?limit=100&state=ACTIVE&monitoring=true&updateInterval=REAL_TIME" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## Fetch Changes for a specific workflow or all workflows

Use the following endpoint to retrieve the changes for a specific workflow or all workflows:

**GET** `/v4/changes`

[See API Reference](/api-reference/monitoring/get-all-changes)

### Example Request

Fetch all changes for all workflows:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Fetch all changes in a time range for a list of specific workflows:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes?workflowIds=123456789,987654321&startDate=2024-11-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-11-30T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
