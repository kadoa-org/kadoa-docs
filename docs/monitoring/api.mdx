<Note>Real-time monitoring is currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).</Note>

Our API enables you to track and manage all your monitored workflows. You can:
- Get all active workflows with monitoring enabled
- Retrieve historical data changes across your workflows


## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, you'll need to:
- Create a Kadoa account
- [Get your API key](/api-reference/introduction)

## 1. Get All Active Monitoring Workflows

Use the following endpoint to retrieve your workflows:

**GET** `/v4/workflows`

[See full API reference](/api-reference/workflows/get-all-workflows)

The response will include all workflows that are in your scope (user, team, organization).

To get all workflows that are active and have real-time monitoring enabled, you can use the following query parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/workflows?limit=100&state=ACTIVE&monitoring=true&updateInterval=REAL_TIME" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 2. Get Historical Data Changes

The `/changes` endpoint returns all historical data changes detected by your monitoring workflows. By default, it returns changes from all your active workflows.
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You can filter changes by workflow and date range using the different query parameters. [See full API reference.](/api-reference/monitoring/get-all-changes)


Example with filters:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes?startDate=2024-11-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-11-30T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Differences Field Explanation

Each change includes a `differences` array showing structured representations of what changed:

```json
{
  "differences": [
    {
      "type": "changed",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "title",
          "previousValue": "Old Title",
          "value": "New Title"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The `differences` field provides an object-based diffing with the following structure:

- `type`: The type of change - can be `added`, `removed`, or `changed`
- `fields`: All fields of the object (even if unchanged)

Each field change includes:
- `key`: Field name that was changed
- `value`: Current field value
- `previousValue`: Previous field value (only present for `changed` type)

#### Example

Let's look at a simplified example with three fields: `id`, `name`, and `status`.

Data before change:
```json
{
  "products": [
    { "id": "001", "name": "Product A", "status": "In Stock" },
    { "id": "002", "name": "Product B", "status": "Low Stock" },
    { "id": "003", "name": "Product C", "status": "Out of Stock" },
    { "id": "004", "name": "Product D", "status": "In Stock" }
  ]
}
```

Data after change:
```json
{
  "products": [
    { "id": "001", "name": "Product A Premium", "status": "In Stock" },
    { "id": "003", "name": "Product C", "status": "In Stock" },
    { "id": "004", "name": "Product D", "status": "In Stock" },
    { "id": "005", "name": "Product E", "status": "New Arrival" }
  ]
}
```

The `differences` field would show:

```json
{
  "differences": [
    {
      "type": "changed",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "id",
          "previousValue": "001",
          "value": "001"
        },
        {
          "key": "name",
          "previousValue": "Product A",
          "value": "Product A Premium"
        },
        {
          "key": "status",
          "previousValue": "In Stock",
          "value": "In Stock"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "removed",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "id",
          "value": "002"
        },
        {
          "key": "name",
          "value": "Product B"
        },
        {
          "key": "status",
          "value": "Low Stock"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "changed",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "id",
          "previousValue": "003",
          "value": "003"
        },
        {
          "key": "name",
          "previousValue": "Product C",
          "value": "Product C"
        },
        {
          "key": "status",
          "previousValue": "Out of Stock",
          "value": "In Stock"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "added",
      "fields": [
        {
          "key": "id",
          "value": "005"
        },
        {
          "key": "name",
          "value": "Product E"
        },
        {
          "key": "status",
          "value": "New Arrival"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note that item with `id: "004"` remains unchanged, so it doesn't appear in the differences array.
