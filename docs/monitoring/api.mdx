<Note>Real-time monitoring is currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).</Note>

Our API enables you to track and manage all your monitored workflows. You can:
- Get all active workflows with monitoring enabled
- Retrieve historical data changes across your workflows


## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:
- Create a Kadoa account
- [Get your API key](/api-reference/introduction)

## 1. Get All Active Monitoring Workflows

Use the following endpoint to retrieve your workflows:

**GET** `/v4/workflows`

[See full API reference](/api-reference/workflows/get-all-workflows)

The response will include all workflows that are in your scope (user, team, organization).

To get all workflows that are active and have real-time monitoring enabled, you can use the following query parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/workflows?limit=100&state=ACTIVE&monitoring=true&updateInterval=REAL_TIME" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 2. Get Historical Data Changes

The `/changes` endpoint returns all historical data changes detected by your monitoring workflows. By default, it returns changes from all your active workflows.
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

You can filter changes by workflow and date range using the different query parameters. [See full API reference.](/api-reference/monitoring/get-all-changes)


Example with filters:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes?startDate=2024-11-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-11-30T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Diff Field Explanation
Each change includes a `diff` array showing what changed between changes:
```json
    {
      "value": "\"title\": \"somethingChanged\"\n}",
      "added": true,
      "removed": null,
      "count": 2
    }
```

- `value`: The changed text
- `added`: `true` if text was added
- `removed`: `true` if text was removed
- `count`: Number of lines changed

<Note>For real-time updates, consider using our [WebSocket SDK](/docs/monitoring/websocket) instead of polling this endpoint.</Note>
