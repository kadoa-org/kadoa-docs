<Note>Real-time monitoring is currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).</Note>

With our API, you can conveniently manage all your workflows that have monitoring enabled. You can:

- Get all active workflows that have monitoring enabled.
- Get historical data changes for one or multiple workflows.


## Prerequisites
To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:
- Create a Kadoa account
- [Get your API key](/api-reference/introduction)

## 1. Get All Active Monitoring Workflows

Use the following endpoint to retrieve your workflows:

**GET** `/v4/workflows`

[See API Reference](/api-reference/workflows/get-all-workflows)

The response will include all workflows that are in your scope (user, team, organization).

To get all workflows that are active and have real-time monitoring enabled, you can use the following query parameter:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/workflows?limit=100&state=ACTIVE&monitoring=true&updateInterval=REAL_TIME" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

## 2. Get Changes for Workflows

The following endpoint returns historical data changes detected by your monitoring workflows. A "change" means the monitor spotted a relevant change in the data since the last check.

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

[See API Reference](/api-reference/monitoring/get-all-changes)

To fetch changes in a specific time range for specific workflows, you can use the corresponding query params:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/changes?workflowIds=123456789,987654321&startDate=2024-11-01T00:00:00Z&endDate=2024-11-30T23:59:59Z" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Diff Field Explanation
Each change includes a `diff` array that shows what changed between checks. Each entry in diff represents text that was added or removed.

- `value`: The text that changed.
- `added`: true if this text is new in the latest version.
- `removed`: true if this text was removed.
- `count`: How many lines the changed text includes.
