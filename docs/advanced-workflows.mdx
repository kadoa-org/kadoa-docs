The new Advanced Workflow feature in Kadoa offers exciting possibilities beyond simple web data extraction:

- **Record and replay**: Capture your interactions with a webpage, allowing Kadoa to automatically replicate them later.
- **Action sequences**: Apply a series of actions to the extracted data, such as formatting, segmentation, and more, for enhanced data processing.

Creating an advanced workflow involves two steps:

1. Use the Kadoa Chrome extension to select the data.
2. Use the Kadoa Workflow Builder to configure actions and set data destinations.

## Step 1. Use Kadoa Chrome extension to pick the data

- [Install the Kadoa Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kadoa-ai-web-scraper/nmmlhnjgcechchnkjpkofkjemmlfbnnd).
- Navigate to the webpage containing the data you want to extract.
- Open the Kadoa extension.
- If the webpage requires interactions to display the desired data, **record** your interactions so that Kadoa can replay them later.
- Once the data is visible, **select** one or more elements that contain it, and specify the type of data you want to extract.
- After clicking `Continue`, you'll be redirected to the Kadoa workflow builder.

## Step 2. Use Kadoa Workflow builder to configure actions and destinations

An advanced workflow consists of three sections: source, actions, and destinations. You have already configured the source data using the Kadoa Chrome extension. Now, use the Workflow Builder to add actions and define destinations for your data.

Finally, click the **Test Run** button. Kadoa will process the sample data for free and send you an email notification once the data is ready for review.
