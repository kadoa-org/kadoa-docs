## How do Kadoa credits work?

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of the costs associated with running a data workflow:

### Workflows

| Action                       | Cost          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------- |
| Minimum charge per run       | 10 credits    |
| Extracting a data row        | 2 credits     |

**What is a data row?**

A data row refers to a single row of results in the data table visible on your Kadoa dashboard.

If your workflow extracts 100 data rows, the total cost for one run would be  
`100 rows * 2 = 200 credits`

If your workflow extracts 20 data rows:  
`20 rows * 2 = 40 credits`

If your workflow extracts only 2 data rows:  
`2 rows * 2 = 4 credits => 10 credits`  
(billed at the minimum run cost of 10 credits)

### Instant Data Extraction API

| Action                                                 | Cost          |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------- |
| Extracting a normal page                               | 50 credits    |
| Extracting a page with user-set location (countryCode) | 200 credits   |

Synchronous data extraction is more challenging and has higher infrastructure costs associated with it.

## Do credits expire?

Yes, credits are valid for one billable month, leftovers are not rolled-over to the next month.

## What happens if a website can't be scraped?

We only charge for successful requests. If there should be any technical issues with a scraper, we'll investigate it as soon as possible.

## Do enterprise customers also get credits?

No, enterprise customers have custom usage commitments depending on their volume and update frequency.
