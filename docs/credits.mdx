## Overview

Kadoa uses a credit system to charge for different types of usage. Each task costs a certain number of credits.

<Note>
    Enterprise customers have custom usage limits. To discuss a tailored enterprise plan, [contact our sales

## Credit Costs

### 1. Workflows

Workflows automatically extract data rows on a schedule.

| Type                  |   Cost     |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
|Minimum cost per run | 10 credits |
|Cost per data row  | 2 credits  |

Examples:

- 100 data rows: `200 credits`
- Extracting 3 rows: `10 credits` (minimum charge applies)



### 2. Adhoc Extractions

Adhoc extractions let you instantly extract data from a single webpage. Unlike workflows which run on a schedule, these are one-time extractions that run instantly when requested.

| Type                                                   | Cost        |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- |
|  Basic extraction (`"html"`, `"markdown"`, `"body"`)    | 1 credit    |
| Structured extraction (with template)                   | 10 credits  |
| Location-specific extraction (additional)          | +5 credits  |

### 3. Web Crawling

| Type                                                 | Cost      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Crawling a page                                 | 1 credit  |
| Crawling with location (`countryCode`)        | 5 credits |

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do credits expire?**  
Yes. All credits are valid for one billable month and do not carry over into the following month.

**What happens if a website can’t be scraped?**  
You are only charged for successful requests. If there are any technical issues, we’ll investigate as soon as possible.

**Do enterprise customers also get credits?**  
Enterprise customers have custom usage commitments rather than a standard credit plan. [Contact our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/pricing/enterprise) if you have high-volume data needs.
