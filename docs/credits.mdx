## Overview

Kadoa uses a credit system to handle different types of data extraction and crawling tasks. Credits are valid for one billable month and do not roll over. If a website can’t be scraped successfully due to technical issues, you won’t be charged for that request.

**Note:** Enterprise customers have custom usage commitments depending on volume and update frequency. To discuss a tailored enterprise plan, [contact our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/pricing/enterprise).

## Pricing Categories

### 1. Workflow

Workflows are automated data tasks that run repeatedly to extract data rows. A single *data row* is one line of results in the table on your Kadoa dashboard.

| Action                  | Cost       |
| ----------------------- | ---------- |
| **Minimum charge per run** | 10 credits |
| **Extracting a data row**  | 2 credits  |

**Examples**

- **100 data rows**: `100 * 2 = 200 credits`  
- **20 data rows**: `20 * 2 = 40 credits`  
- **2 data rows**: `2 * 2 = 4 credits => 10 credits` (billed at the minimum run cost)

### 2. Adhoc

Adhoc requests refer to on-demand, one-off data extractions.

| Action                                                   | Cost        |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| With a template (structured extraction)                  | 10 credits  |
| With a template (structured) + user-set location         | 15 credits  |
| Without a template (`"html"`, `"markdown"`, `"body"`)    | 1 credit    |
| Without a template + user-set location                   | 5 credits   |

### 3. Crawling

Credits are charged based on the number of pages crawled.

| Action                                                 | Cost      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------- |
| Crawling a normal page                                 | 1 credit  |
