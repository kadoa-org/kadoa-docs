Kadoa allows you to monitor websites for data changes and receive notifications when updates occur. Follow these steps to configure data monitoring:

## 1. Create a Workflow

- [Create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add) for the website you want to monitor.

## 2. Schedule the Workflow

- When approving the sample data, click "Repeat Workflow" to set up regular updates.
- Choose an update frequency between every 12 hours and every month.
- Enterprise customers can request real-time monitoring (sub-5-second updates).

## 3. Configure Monitoring

- In the monitoring settings, select the fields you want to track for changes.
- Choose your preferred notification channel. Self-service users can receive email notifications. Enterprise customers have access to additional integration options.

## 4. Receive Change Notifications

- When Kadoa detects a change in the monitored fields, you'll receive a notification via your configured channel.
- You can also view the change history in the workflow run history.
