title: Chrome Extension

The Kadoa Chrome extension offers more flexibility than our auto-detect setup. This "What You Click Is What You Get" approach allows you to precisely extract and monitor the data you need.

## When to use
Use the Kadoa Chrome extension when you need precise control over the data you want to extract or monitor. This method is ideal if:

- Kadoa’s auto-detect feature doesn't capture the specific data you need.
- You prefer a hands-on approach to selecting data directly from a webpage.

## How to use

- Navigate to the webpage containing the data you want to extract.
- Open the Kadoa extension.
- Select one or more objects containing the data you'd like to extract.
- Review and refine the suggested fields.
- Your new workflow is ready. To set up monitoring and receive notifications about data changes, please [read more here](/docs/monitoring).

## Security

The Kadoa Chrome extension operates within the user’s active tab. Here is the complete list of requested permissions:

- [activeTab](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/develop/concepts/activeTab): Allows the extension to record interactions (e.g., clicks, key presses) and select elements within the active tab.
- [storage](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage#permissions): To use Kadoa extension, user needs to be logged in to their Kadoa account. API key is used for auth, and is stored in local storage to persist between sessions.
- [scripting](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/scripting): Supports rendering the extension UI when the user clicks the toolbar button.
- [cookies](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/cookies), in combination with host_permissions `["*://*.kadoa.com/*"]` : Allows the extension to read the team ID cookie, set by the Kadoa web app and scoped to the [kadoa.com](http://kadoa.com/) domain, to determine the active workspace.
- [browsingData](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/browsingData): Required to clear the current tab’s cache (via `chrome.browsingData.removeCache`) for accurate click event detection.
- [sidePanel](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/sidePanel): Utilizes Chrome’s Side Panel API for the extension’s UI.
- [tabs](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/tabs): Listens to tab-related events, such as closing the side panel when the user switches tabs.
- [webNavigation](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/webNavigation): Detects when the user reloads the current page while the extension is active.

The Kadoa extension sends the following information to our servers:

- User API key: For authentication.
- Active tab URL and content: For processing and extracting selected data.

The source code is not currently open source but is available for inspection upon request.

## Troubleshooting

**The extension does not open.**

This issue is most likely because the webpage has not yet finished loading. Please reload the page and wait until it is fully loaded.

**Unable to change anything on a webpage after opening the Kadoa extension**

Ensure the page has fully loaded and all elements you want to select are visible before clicking the Kadoa extension icon. This includes expanding any collapsed areas and closing any blocking pop-ups.

**Unable to select the desired element because it is covered by nested elements**

Select any nested element, then click the arrow icon to select its parent element.

**The page reloads after closing the extension**

This is an intended behavior. To make elements available for selection, Kadoa removes all event handlers from the page. The page is reloaded to restore these handlers.
