<Note>
    {" "}
    Workspaces are currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).
</Note>


For teams that want to collaborate on Kadoa, we offer shared workspaces. Workspaces offer 4 benefits:

- Shared billing: Rather than having each of your team members individually create & manage subscriptions, all of your team’s character usage and billing is centralized under one workspace.
- Shared workflows: Within a workspace, your team can share workflows.
- Access management: Your workspace admin can easily add and remove team members.
- API Key management: You can issue and revoke API keys for your team.


## Creating a Workspace

Workspaces are automatically enabled for all Enterprise clients. When setting up your account, you’ll be asked to nominate a workspace admin who will have the power to add more team members as well as nominate others to be an admin.

## Adding team members

<Info> Only admins can add and remove team members. </Info>

To access your workspace settings, select your profile in the bottom left of the dashboard and choose Workspace Settings.


## Roles

In the Kadoa ecosystem, users can have two primary roles: **Member** and **Admin**. Each role comes with different levels of access to workflows and data management. The access levels are defined based on privileges granted for certain actions such as reading, creating, updating, or deleting workflows.

The permissions for each action are determined based on the user's role in the team.

### Member Role
A **Member** has basic privileges that allow them to interact with workflows but with limited control over system configuration or team settings.

**Permissions for Members:**
  - Can **Read** team workflows
  - Can **Create** new workflows in their team
  - Can **Update** existing team workflows
  - Can **Delete** their own workflows
  - Can **Execute** team workflows

### Admin Role
An **Admin** has higher privileges compared to a Member. Admins have full access to manage workflows and data, as well as perform administrative tasks for the team.

**Permissions for Admins:**
  - All **Member** permissions within their team
  - Can manage **team settings** and team members
  - Can **Delete** or modify any workflow within their team
  - Can customize and manage workflow **schemas and templates** for their team
  - Can change user roles within their team
  - Team Owners can transfer team ownership to another team member

### Compliance Officer Role
A **Compliance Officer** has read-only access for compliance and audit purposes.

**Permissions for Compliance Officers:**
 - Can **Read** workflows and execution logs
 - Can access audit reports
 - Cannot modify workflows or settings


> Note: Each role's permissions are strictly limited to their assigned team's resources. Users cannot access or modify data from other teams within the organization.

## Managing API Keys

To manage your API keys, select your account page in the bottom left of the dashboard. There you’ll be able to see your team API keys.
