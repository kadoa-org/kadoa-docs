## Overview of Roles

In the Kadoa ecosystem, users can have two primary roles: **Member** and **Admin**. Each role comes with different levels of access to workflows and data management. The access levels are defined based on privileges granted for certain actions such as reading, creating, updating, or deleting workflows.

### Member Role
A **Member** has basic privileges that allow them to interact with workflows but with limited control over system configuration or team settings.

- **Permissions for Members:**
  - Can **Read** workflows
  - Can **Create** new workflows
  - Can **Update** existing workflows
  - Can **Delete** their own workflows
  - Can **Execute** workflows

### Admin Role
An **Admin** has higher privileges compared to a Member. Admins have full access to manage workflows and data, as well as perform administrative tasks for the team.

- **Permissions for Admins:**
  - All **Member** permissions (Read, Create, Update, Delete, Execute)
  - Can manage **team settings** and other users
  - Can **Delete** or modify any workflow within the team
  - Can customize and manage workflow **schemas and templates**
  - Can change one user role within a team the admin belongs to

> A team owner has privileges equivalent to an admin, the only difference is that only a team owner can transfer team ownership to another user in the same team.

## Permission Management

The permissions for each action are determined based on the user's role in the team. The following code shows how permissions are evaluated based on whether the user is a Member or Admin


## API integration

User identity is checked against a Bearer token (jwt) or user API key, however the recommended approach is to use jwt for users as they expire over an arbitrary defined time.
