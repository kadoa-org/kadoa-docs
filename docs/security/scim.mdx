<Note>
    {" "}
    SCIM is currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).
</Note>

## Requirements

> ask support if you need further assistance
> 
- Kadoa team created
- Kadoa `scim-token` (one per team)
- SSO configured for a team

Once SCIM is enabled for a team, team members are read only in Kadoa dashboard (only role can be changed), user management will be fully externalized to the IdP.


## Configuration

### Microsoft Entra

In your enterprise application, set the Provisioning Mode to `Automatic`.

Enter the SCIM endpoint URL provided by Kadoa, usually in the format:

`https://api.kadoa.com/scim/v2`

For authentication, use the SCIM token provided by Kadoa Team.

## FAQ

- How to manage team users roles in Kadoa?

Users roles are managed independently from SCIM in Kadoa dashboard or from dedicated API

- What IdP is supported by Kadoa with SCIM?

Microsoft Entra has been tested to operate with Kadoa and can automatically provision users. Other identity providers may be compatible out-of-the-box since SCIM 2.0 is a standard format; however, compatibility cannot be guaranteed unless the provider has passed the testing phase. If your team requires integration with a specific identity provider for the Kadoa SCIM endpoint, please reach out.

- What version of SCIM is used?

✅ SCIM 2.0 (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7643)

❌ SCIM 1.1 is not supported
