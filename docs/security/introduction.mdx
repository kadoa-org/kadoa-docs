An overview of Kadoa security features and practices.

## Governance
Kadoa establishes policies and controls, monitors compliance with those controls, and proves the security and compliance to third-party auditors.

Our policies are based on the following foundational principles:
<CardGroup cols={2}>
    <Card title="Least Priviledge">
        Access should be limited to only those with a legitimate business needs, based on the principle of least
        privilege.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Consistency">
        Security controls should be applied consistently across all areas of the enterprise.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Defense in Depth">
        Security controls should be implemented and layered according to the principle of defense-in-depth.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Continuous Improvement">
        The implementation of controls should be iterative, continuously improving effectiveness and decreasing
        friction.
    </Card>
</CardGroup>


## Data Protection
<Card title="Data at rest">
    All data stores are encrypted at rest.
</Card>
    <Card title="Data in transit">
    Kadoa uses TLS 1.3 or higher everywhere data is transmitted over networks.
</Card>
    <Card title="Data backup">
    Kadoa backs-up all production data using a point-in-time approach. Backups are persisted for 30 days, and are
    globally replicated for resiliency against regional disasters.
</Card>

## Product Security

### Penetration testing
Kadoa engages with third-party firms to conduct penetration testing at least annually.

All areas of the Kadoa product and cloud infrastructure are in-scope for these assessments, and source code is fully available to the testers in order to maximize the effectiveness and coverage.

### Vulnerability scanning
Kadoa uses multiple vulnerability monitoring techniques including code-level scanning, dependency scanning, and security reviews to identify and remediate vulnerabilities.

Vulnerabilities are prioritized based on severity and risk, and are remediated according to a schedule.
