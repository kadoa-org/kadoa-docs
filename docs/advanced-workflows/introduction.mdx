## Platform Features

### Data Sources
Kadoa lets you extract data from any unstructured data source. For example:
- **Browser Automation**: Record and replay complex interactions like clicks, form fills, and page navigation
- **Crawling & Discovery**: Automatically discover and process content across multiple pages of a website
- **CSV Batch Processing**: Upload CSV files containing URLs or file paths for bulk data extraction
- **PDF Processing**: Extract structured data from financial reports, regulatory filings, and other documents
- **Email Integration**: Process data from email attachments and message content

### Data Processing (Actions)
Once data is collected, you can:
- **Transformation**: Clean, format, and structure the data
- **Validation**: Apply rules and constraints to ensure data quality
- **Enrichment**: Combine data from multiple sources or add computed fields
- **Classification**: Categorize and tag content
- **Filter**: Filter for specific conditions or remove duplicates


### Data Destinations
After processing, load data wherever you need:
- **Export Options**: CSV, JSON, API endpoints, or custom destinations
- **Scheduling**: Configure run frequency and update triggers
- **Monitoring & Notifications**: Get alerts or webhook events for changes or completion



## Getting Started
The Kadoa Workflow Builder lets you create any unstructured data workflow by configuring `sources`, `actions`, and `destinations` - all in a single place.

### 1. Configure a Data Source
Configure a data source by either setting up a website crawler, uploading a CSV, or using any other unstructured data source

### 2. Build a Workflow

An advanced workflow consists of three sections: source, actions, and destinations. You have already configured the source data using the Kadoa Chrome extension. Now, use the Workflow Builder to add actions and define destinations for your data.

### 3. Run a Workflow

Finally, click the `Run now` button. Kadoa will process a sample of your data for free and send you an email once itâ€™s ready for review. If everything looks good, you can run it at scale.
