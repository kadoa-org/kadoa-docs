Advanced Workflows enable complex data workflow scenarios beyond basic web scraping.
This guide covers the key features and how to get started.



## Platform Features

- **Crawling & Discovery**: Automatically discover and process content across multiple pages of a website
- **CSV Batch Processing**: Upload CSV files containing URLs or file paths for bulk data extraction
- **PDF Processing**: Extract structured data from financial reports, regulatory filings, and other documents
- **Email Integration**: Process data from email attachments and message content

### Data Processing
- **Transformation**: Clean, format, and structure the data
- **Validation**: Apply rules and constraints to ensure data quality
- **Enrichment**: Combine data from multiple sources or add computed fields
- **Classification**: Categorize and tag content
- **Filter**: Filter for specific conditions or remove duplicates


### Data Destinations
- **Export Options**: CSV, JSON, API endpoints, or custom destinations
- **Scheduling**: Configure run frequency and update triggers
- **Monitoring & Notifications**: Get alerts or webhook events for changes or completion



## Getting Started

Advanced Workflows are built using two main tools:

1. Use the Kadoa Chrome extension to record interactions and select the data.
2. Use the Kadoa Workflow Builder to configure actions and set data destinations.

## Step 1. Use Kadoa Chrome extension to pick the data

- [Install the Kadoa Chrome extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/kadoa-ai-web-scraper/nmmlhnjgcechchnkjpkofkjemmlfbnnd).
- Navigate to the webpage containing the data you want to extract.
- Open the Kadoa extension.
- If the webpage requires interactions to display the desired data, **record** your interactions so that Kadoa can replay them later.
- Once the data is visible, **select** one or more elements that contain it, and specify the type of data you want to extract.
- After clicking `Continue`, you'll be redirected to the Kadoa workflow builder.

## Step 2. Use Kadoa Workflow builder to configure actions and destinations

An advanced workflow consists of three sections: source, actions, and destinations. You have already configured the source data using the Kadoa Chrome extension. Now, use the Workflow Builder to add actions and define destinations for your data.

  We're actively working on implementing more actions and destinations.

Finally, click the **Test Run** button. Kadoa will process the sample data for free and send you an email notification once the data is ready for review.
