The Kadoa Advanced Workflow API provides endpoints to manage workflows efficiently. In this guide, you'll learn how to:

- Fetch workflow data
- Fetch workflow configuration
- Update an existing workflow
- Delete a workflow

## Create an Advanced Workflow
Creation of new advanced workflows is currently only possible via our Chrome Extension or our Workflow Builder in the Kadoa Dashboard.
Please refer to the [Setup Guide](/docs/advanced-workflows/setup) for more information.


## Fetch Workflow Data

Use the following endpoint to retrieve details about a specific workflow:

**GET** `/v4/workflows/{workflowId}/data`

[See API Reference](/api-reference/workflows/get-workflow-data-by-id)



The response will include the result data and some additional metadata about the workflow run.

```
{
  "workflowId": "123456789",
  "runId": "987654321",
  "executedAt": "2024-11-07T07:24:14.317Z",
  "data": [
    ...
  ],
  "pagination": {
    "totalCount": 1,
    "page": 1,
    "totalPages": 1,
    "limit": 25
  }
}
```

## Fetch Workflow Configuration
Use the following endpoint to retrieve the configuration of an advanced workflow:

**GET** `/v4/advanced-workflows/{workflowId}`

### Request Parameters

- **workflowId** (string, required): The ID of the workflow to fetch.
- **Authorization** (header, required): API key for authorization.

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/advanced-workflows/123456789" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

### Response
The response will include the workflow configuration.

```

      }

        }
      ],
      "params": {
        "schema": [
          {
            "name": "revenue",
            "example": "$123121",
            "description": "Annual revenue number listed at the top of the document"
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```



## Update Workflow Steps

To update the steps in an existing workflow, use the following endpoint:

**POST** `/v4/advanced-workflows/{workflowId}/steps`

### Request Parameters

- **workflowId** (string, required): The ID of the workflow to update.
- **Authorization** (header, required): API key for authorization.
- **steps** (array body, required): An array containing the all steps.

<Note>
    This endpoint requires the complete array of workflow steps. Partial updates are not supported yet - you must include all existing steps even if you're only modifying one.
</Note>


### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.kadoa.com/v4/workflows/123456789/steps" \
  -H "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "steps": [
      {
        "id": "step_1",
        "version": 1,
        "name": "CSVLoader",
        "type": "input",
        "modifiedAt": "2024-11-07T11:37:50.626Z",
        "params": {
          "url": "mycsv.csv",
          "outputFields": [
            "url"
          ],
          "outputType": "application/pdf",
          "maxRecords": 100
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "step_2",
        "name": "ExtractPDF",
        "type": "action",
        "inputs": [
          {
            "id": "step_1"
          }
        ],
        "params": {
          "schema": [
            {
              "name": "revenue",
              "example": "$123121",
              "description": "Annual revenue number listed at the top of the document"
            },
            {
              "name": "costs",
              "example": "$999",
              "description": "Annual costs listed at the top of the document"
            }
          ]
        }
      }
    ]
  }'
```

You can now test the updated workflow by using the [/run](/api-reference/workflows/run-a-workflow) endpoint and fetch the result data.

### Response
The response will indicate whether the steps were successfully updated, along with the new version of the workflow.

## Delete Workflow

To delete a workflow, use the following endpoint:

**DELETE** `/v4/workflows/{workflowId}`

[See API Reference](/api-reference/workflows/delete-a-workflow)
