## 1. Configure the source
Kadoa enables you to easily extract data from any website. You can configure the source of a workflow in a few different ways.

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Auto-Detect Setup (recommended)">
        Best for: Getting started quickly.

        Our AI automatically analyzes the data source and suggests what data can be extracted.

        1. Go to your Kadoa Dashboard and [add a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add)
        2. Enter your URL and let Kadoa analyze the page structure
        3. Review and customize the suggested data fields

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="list" title="Multiple URLs">
        Best for: Extractions from a specific set of pages.

        When you have a handful of specific pages from the same website, simply paste your URLs directly. Ideal when you don't need to extract an entire section or category.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="brackets-curly" title="Dynamic URLs">
        Best for: Extractions with predictable URL patterns (e.g. search queries, product IDs, locations).

        Use when you need to scrape multiple pages that follow a consistent URL structure. Add placeholders (%%) that Kadoa will automatically fill with your provided values.

        ```
        https://site.com?search=%%
        https://site.com/location/%%/jobs
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="chrome" title="Chrome Extension">
        Best for: Complex pages or specific data selections. The Chrome extension lets you manually select the exact data you want to extract.

        1. Install the [Kadoa Chrome Extension](/docs/chrome-extension).
        2. Navigate to your the website you want to use as a data source.
        3. Use the extension to select the specific data fields you want to extract.
        4. Create a new workflow from the selected data.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="copy" title="Templates">
        Best for: Consistent data extraction across multiple similar websites.


        Start with a pre-built or custom template if you want to reuse a data schema across many sites. Learn more about templates [here](/docs/data-schemas).

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="code" title="API">
        Best for: Programmatic workflow creation and automation

        Use our API to programmatically create and manage your workflows.

<Note>We provide a white-glove migration service as part of our Enterprise plan. You can request it by [contacting us](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).</Note>


## 2. Customize your data schema

Kadoa will automatically detect and suggest relevant data fields based on the type of data you selected. You can further customize this schema to fit your specific needs by adding, removing, or renaming fields.

If you need to gather more details from linked pages, turn on the option to navigate to each linked page and extract data.


## 3. Schedule your workflow

Choose how often you want Kadoa to run a workflow.
You can run your workflow once or set it up on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, etc.).

You can also enable [monitoring](/docs/monitoring) to get alerts when Kadoa notices changes in the data.

## 4. Review sample data
Kadoa processes a few pages first to ensure the data meets your requirements before running a full extraction.

<Note>
    You'll receive an email notification when your sample data is ready for review
</Note>

The sample shows how your data will be structured using values from a few representative pages. If everything looks good, approve it to start the full extraction. If not, you can adjust your data fields and quickly rerun the sample.

<Tip>
    Don't worry about complex pagination or scrolling - Kadoa automatically handles all navigation for you.
</Tip>


## 5. Access your data

When your workflow finishes, the results appear in your Kadoa dashboard. You can either use our powerful [API](/api-reference), or export the data in CSV or JSON format for use in other applications.

That’s it. You’ve got your data with no need for custom code.
