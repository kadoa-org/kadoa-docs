## 1. Sign up for a Kadoa account

Head over to [kadoa.com](https://kadoa.com) and sign up for an account. Once you're logged in, you'll be taken to your dashboard where you can start creating workflows.

## 2. Create a new workflow

### Option 1: Auto-Detect Setup

<Note>Use this option if you want to extract the main information on a website, such as a directory of products, news, events, or jobs.</Note>

1. Use our [auto-detect flow on the Kadoa dashboard](https://kadoa.com/add), where Kadoa automatically analyzes the page and shows what data is available.
2. Edit and customize the suggested data schema to fit your needs.


### Option 2: Chrome Extension

<Note>Use this option if you want to select specific data on a page to monitor or extract. This "What You See Is What You Get" approach is usually the better choice for precise monitoring.</Note>

1. Install the [Kadoa Chrome Extension](/docs/chrome-extension).
2. Navigate to your the website you want to use as a data source.
3. Use the extension to select the specific data fields you want to extract.
4. Create a new workflow from the selected data.

## 3. Customize your data schema

Kadoa will automatically detect and suggest relevant data fields based on the type of data you selected. You can further customize this schema to fit your specific needs by adding, removing, or renaming fields.

At this stage, you can also choose to scrape detail pages of a directory if needed.


## 4. Review sample data and approve the results

Kadoa will process a limited number of sample pages from the website to give you an idea of the results.
Review this sample data, and if you're happy with the results, approve the workflow. If you need to make adjustments, you can edit the workflow and rerun the sample extraction.

You can also choose to number of items Kadoa should extract. Kadoa will navigate and scroll through the pages automatically.

## 5. Schedule your workflow

Once you've approved the workflow, choose how often you want Kadoa to scrape new data for you.
You can run your workflow manually, set it up on a recurring schedule (e.g. daily, weekly), or trigger it based on specific events.

You can also enable [monitoring](/docs/monitoring) for the website and get alerts when Kadoa detects changes in the data.

## 6. Access your data

After your workflow has run, the extracted data will be available right in your Kadoa dashboard. You can either use our powerful [API](/api-reference), or export it in CSV or JSON format for use in other applications.

That's it! With just a few clicks, you can start extracting valuable data from any website, no coding required.
