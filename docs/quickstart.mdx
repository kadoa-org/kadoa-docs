## 1. Configure the source
Kadoa enables you to easily create a workflow for any website. There are multiple ways of doing that:

<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion icon="wand-magic-sparkles" title="Auto-Detect Setup (recommended)">

        - Go to your Kadoa Dasbhoard and [add a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add).
        - Kadoa analyzes the source automatically and shows what data it can extract.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="list" title="Multiple URLs">
        Add multiple URLs for the same website if you want to run an extraction on just a few same pages.
    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="brackets-curly" title="Dynamic URLs">
        Add dynamic URLs using a placeholder and a list of values.
        Helpful for URLs with search queries, product IDs, and similar patterns.
        ```
        https://site.com?search=%%
        ```

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="chrome" title="Chrome Extension">
        Use the extension to pick exactly what data you want from a page.

        1. Install the [Kadoa Chrome Extension](/docs/chrome-extension).
        2. Navigate to your the website you want to use as a data source.
        3. Use the extension to select the specific data fields you want to extract.
        4. Create a new workflow from the selected data.

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="copy" title="Templates">

        Start with a pre-built or custom template if you want to reuse a data schema across many sites. Learn more about templates [here](/docs/data-schemas).

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion icon="code" title="API">

        Programmatically create workflows using the API, which is useful if you’re building many similar workflows.
        See the API reference [here](/api-reference/workflows/create-a-new-workflow).

    </Accordion>

## 2. Customize your data schema

Kadoa will automatically detect and suggest relevant data fields based on the type of data you selected. You can further customize this schema to fit your specific needs by adding, removing, or renaming fields.

At this stage, you can also choose to navigate to each linked detail page and extract data from there.

## 3. Schedule your workflow

Choose how often you want Kadoa to run a workflow.
You can run your workflow once or set it up on a recurring schedule (daily, weekly, etc.).

You can also enable [monitoring](/docs/monitoring) to get alerts when Kadoa notices changes in the data.

## 4. Review sample data

Kadoa processes a few pages first so you can check the quality of the data. If you like it, approve the workflow. If not, edit the workflow and rerun the sample.


You can also decide how many items to extract. Kadoa will handle the scrolling and navigation for you.


## 5. Access your data

When your workflow finishes, the results appear in your Kadoa dashboard. You can either use our powerful [API](/api-reference), or export the data in CSV or JSON format for use in other applications.

That’s it. You’ve got your data with no need for custom code.
