<Note>
  The SDK's currently only support real-time monitoring which is only available
  for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get in touch with our sales
  team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).

Kadoa provides SDKs to simplify features integration. If you use a language or framework that is not supported, you can use our REST API to interact with Kadoa.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this guide, youâ€™ll need to:

- Have access to an existing Team or account, depending on the feature you want to use.
- [Get an API key](/api-reference/introduction)

## Python

Install the Python SDK using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/kadoa-sdk/):

```bash
pip install kadoa-sdk
```

### Listen to real-time changes

```python
from kadoa_sdk import Kadoa
kadoa_props = {
    "team_api_key": TEAM_API_KEY
}

kadoa_client = Kadoa(**kadoa_props)

def process_event(event):
    print(event)

kadoa_client.realtime.listen(process_event)
```

## NodeJS

Install the TypeScript SDK using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kadoa/node):

```bash
npm install @kadoa/node
```

### Listen to real-time changes

```javascript
import { Kadoa } from "@kadoa/node";

const kadoaProps = {
  teamApiKey: process.env.KADOA_TEAM_API_KEY,
};
const kadoaClient = new Kadoa(kadoaProps);

const customProcessEvent = (event) => {
  console.log("Event received:", event);
}

kadoaClient.realtime.listen(customProcessEvent);
```
