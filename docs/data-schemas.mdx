## What is a schema?

Every workflow at Kadoa needs a schema. It tells Kadoa:

- what **entity** to look for in source data (such as products, jobs, news)
- what **fields** to extract for the selected entity (such as title, price, description)

What if you need the same schema for many workflows? The answer is **templates**.

## How to create templates

Kadoa offers two ways to create and manage templates:

### 1. Create a template from scratch

- [Create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add) using Auto-detect
- Configure the workflow schema
- Go to [My Templates](https://www.kadoa.com/my-templates) tab on your dashboard and click 'Add New Template.' You can now reuse a template from an existing workflow. Note: This option is currently not available for workflows that already use a pre-defined template.
- Give your template a name and description
- That's it! You can now create workflows with this template, and the data will be automatically extracted and transformed into your desired format, regardless of the source.
- Note: you can also do this via /dashboard or /workflow/\[id]

### 2. Customize a pre-defined template

- Navigate to [My Templates](https://www.kadoa.com/my-templates) page on your dashboard
- Click "Add new template"
- Choose a pre-defined template as a starting point, based on your use case (e.g., products, jobs, news)
- Customize the template by adding, removing, or modifying fields
- Save your customized template

## Using your templates

When you [create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add), you can choose to use one of your templates.

## Ready-made templates

Kadoa provides [ready-made templates](https://www.kadoa.com/templates) for popular web sources. These templates come with a set of standard fields that Kadoa will extract, but you can still customize them based on your specific needs.

There are also **generic** templates, not limited to any specific source:

- [job postings](#job-postings)
- [ecommerce products](#ecommerce)
- [news articles](#news-article)
