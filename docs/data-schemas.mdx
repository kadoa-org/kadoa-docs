## What is a schema?

Every Kadoa workflow requires a data schema that defines:
1. The **entity** to extract (e.g., products, jobs, news articles)
2. The specific **fields** to capture (e.g., title, price, description)
3. The **format** of the extracted data


What if you need the same schema for many workflows? The answer is **templates**.

## What is a template?
Templates allow you to:
- Standardize data schemas across multiple sources
- Save time by reusing workflow blueprints
- Ensure consistency in your data structure


## How to create templates

There are two ways to create and manage templates:

### 1. Create a template from scratch

* [Create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add) using Auto-detect
* Configure the workflow schema
* Go to [My Templates](https://www.kadoa.com/my-templates) tab on your dashboard and click 'Add New Template.' You can now reuse a template from an existing workflow. Note: This option is currently not available for workflows that already use a pre-defined template.
* Give your template a name and description
* That's it! You can now create workflows with this template, and the data will be automatically extracted and transformed into your desired format, regardless of the source.
* Note: you can also do this via the [Dashboard](https://kadoa.com/dashboard) or workflow plage.

### 2. Customize a pre-built template

* Navigate to [My Templates](https://www.kadoa.com/my-templates) page on your dashboard
* Click "Add new template"
* Choose a pre-defined template as a starting point, based on your use case (e.g., products, jobs, news)
* Customize the template by adding, removing, or modifying fields
* Save your customized template

## Using your templates

When you [create a new workflow](https://kadoa.com/add), you can choose to use one of your templates.

## Pre-built templates

Kadoa provides [prebuilt templates](https://www.kadoa.com/templates) for popular web sources and use cases. These templates come with a set of standard fields that Kadoa will extract, but you can still customize them based on your specific needs.
