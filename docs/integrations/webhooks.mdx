description: Learn how to subscribe to Kadoa webhook events and receive real-time notifications about workflow events.
---

Kadoa webhooks allow you to receive real-time notifications when specific events occur, such as when a workflow finishes or data changes.
By subscribing to webhook events, you can automate actions based on these notifications, like triggering another action in your application.

## Subscribing to Webhook Events

To subscribe to Kadoa webhook events, follow these steps:

1. Make a POST request to the `/v4/webhook-subscriptions` endpoint with the following JSON payload:

```json
{
  "webhookUrl": "https://your-webhook-url.com/kadoa-events",
  "webhookHttpMethod": "POST",
  "events": ["workflow_finished"]
}
```

Replace `"https://your-webhook-url.com/kadoa-events"` with the URL where you want to receive the webhook events.

The `events` array should contain the list of events you want to subscribe to. You can fetch the list of available events by making a GET request to the [events endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/get-the-list-of-available-webhook-events).

## Handling Webhook Events

When a subscribed event occurs, Kadoa will send a POST request to the specified `webhookUrl` with the event payload. The payload will include information about the event, such as the `workflowId` and any relevant data.

Here's an example of how to handle webhook events in an Express.js application:

```javascript
app.post('/kadoa-events', (req, res) => {
  const payload = req.body;
  console.log('Received Kadoa webhook event:', payload);

  // Process the event payload and perform any necessary actions
  // ...

  res.sendStatus(200);
});
```

In this example, when a POST request is received at the `/kadoa-events` endpoint, the event payload is logged, and you can add your own logic to process the event and perform any necessary actions.

## Unsubscribing from Webhook Events

To unsubscribe from webhook events, make a DELETE request to the [unsubscribe endpoint](/api-reference/webhooks/unsubscribe-from-webhook-events), using the ID of the subscription you want to remove.

## Best Practices

- Ensure that your webhook endpoint is accessible from the internet and can handle incoming requests from Kadoa.
- Validate the incoming webhook payload to ensure it originates from Kadoa and contains the expected data.
- Respond with a `200 OK` status code to acknowledge receipt of the webhook event.
- Handle webhook events asynchronously to avoid blocking the response to Kadoa.
