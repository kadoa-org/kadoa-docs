<Note>
    {" "}
    SSO is currently only available for Enterprise customers. To upgrade, [get
    in touch with our sales team](https://www.kadoa.com/contact?type=sales).
</Note>

<Info> Only workspace admins can use this feature. </Info>

Single Sign-On (SSO) allows your team to log in to Kadoa by using your existing identity provider. This means that your team can use the same credentials which they use for other services to log in to Kadoa.

Reach out to us if you want to set this up for your team.
