Kadoa is built as an API-first platform. Everything you can do on your Kadoa Dashboard is also possible with our flexible API.

## Quickstart

- Get your [API key](https://www.kadoa.com/account)
- Create your first workflow on [Kadoa.com](https://www.kadoa.com/add)
- Fetch the data by using our API.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key.

```json
"headers":  {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
}
```
