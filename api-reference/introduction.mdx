Kadoa is built as an API-first platform. Everything you can do on your Kadoa Dashboard is also possible with our flexible API.

## Quickstart

1. Get your [API key](https://www.kadoa.com/account)
- Personal API Key: Found under Account Settings in your Kadoa account.
- Team API Key: Found under Team Settings, grants access to all workflows and data belonging to that team.
2. Create your first workflow on [Kadoa.com](https://www.kadoa.com/add)
3. Fetch the data by using our API.


## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using an API key.

```json
"headers":  {
    "x-api-key": "your-api-key"
}
```
